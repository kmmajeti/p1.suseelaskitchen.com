			<h3>About me :</h3>
			<p>I am currently working as a Principal Software Quality Engineer at <a href="http://www.ptc.com/">PTC Inc.</a>
			and possess more than 15+ years of Software testing (QA) experience in testing web client and server applications.
			I received a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Shivaji University, India. My hobbies are watching 
			TV, gardening and family time. I have always been a fan of Indian food and therefore plan to use this domain to 
			develop a web page with delicious recipes of my wife after this course.</p>
